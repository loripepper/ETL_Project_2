# ETL_Project_2

# Data Collection
I found car crash data on Kaggle. Both databases included information related to the vehicle, information related to the occupant, occupant injuries/fatalities, and whether or not the occupant was wearing his or her seatbelt. 

# Data Cleaning
I loaded the two datasets to a Jupyter notebook for cleaning. I modified the column names and data so that they matched and then concatenated the datasets to form the final dataset.
